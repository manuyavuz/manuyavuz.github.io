I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Computer Engineering](https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr) department of [Bogazici University](https://www.boun.edu.tr) focused on Machine Learning (ML) and Natural language Processing (NLP).

My research interests are:

- Matrix & Tensor factorization methods and their applications on recommendation systems and NLP problems
- Monte Carlo methods
- Efficient ML methods for both large data & limited data
- Text Summarization & Sentence Simplification

At [Inomera Research](https://www.inomera.com), I am the tech lead of the iOS team. At [Netmera](https://www.netmera.com), I design and develop the iOS SDK, and lead the research project which aims to develop an intelligent system that can automatically recommend push notification campaigns. For details, please see my [résumé](../resume/)
